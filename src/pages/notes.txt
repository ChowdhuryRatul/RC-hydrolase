pages directory should contain 
(sometimes this directory can also known as feature)

Provider, Page specific layouts for the MAIN PAGE.

Main page meaning could be something like home page, user's profile page, etc.

(main difference between Pages and Features is Pages are the main page, and Features are the stuff you can do in that page.)

directory pattern:
    src
    |___pages
    |   |___users
    |       |___UserProvider.jsx (to provide user information)
    |       |___Users.jsx (Main user page)
    |       |___... (any additional pages)
    |
    |___feature
    |   |___users (within users directory, we know the feature underneath is used for User page)
    |       |___setting
    |       |   |___SettingProvider.jsx (to get default settings of the user)
    |       |   |___Setting.jsx (the main setting feature)
    |       |
    |       |___payment
    |           |___PaymentProvider.jsx (to get default payment information of the user)
    |           |___Payment.jsx (the main payment feature)
